module 4 humbled me, it forces the reader to apply their python skills to real world scenarios like, data visualization, ETL, and OOP. 
The labs were more challenging this time around but thats always a good thing. Im glad Roark doesnt go to easy on us.
I took my time completing this module to make sure i was truly comprehending what i was learning, i recommend other students do the same.
