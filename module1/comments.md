July 15th - 
    Half way through Module 1 and so far so good. I'm breezing through since I am pretty familiar with Python already.
    The info covered is highly valuable and well structured for someone who is starting at zero, and for those reviewing the basics.
    I particularily enjoyed the videos, I'm pretty sure its an ai voice but it actually sounds human therefore easy to watch.
    I also appreciated the fact that you can leave comments on the videos and speed it up to your needs.

    module 1 section 4 " Identity Operators and Membership Operators" the code example for is and is not operators is not shown. it is repeated.
