# Dr. Roark's Intro To Scripting

This repository contains my work through Dr. Roark's Introduction to Scripting course materials using Python. I have been given early access to Dr. Roark's updated intro to scripting book and am working through each module systematically.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into 5 modules, each containing:
- **labs/**: Directory containing lab exercises and solutions
- **comments**: File containing my feedback and observations after completing the module

```

## Learning Approach

For each module, I follow this process:
1. Study the module content from Dr. Roark's book
2. Complete all lab exercises in the `labs/` directory
3. Document my thoughts, challenges, and feedback in the `comments` file
4. Move on to the next module

## About

This work is based on Dr. Roark's Introduction to Scripting book, focusing on Python programming fundamentals. The materials are used with permission for educational purposes.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the lab solutions and read my comments on each module. Each module builds upon previous concepts, so it's recommended to review them in order.
