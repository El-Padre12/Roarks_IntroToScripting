so far module3 section1 is a well of knowledge on data structures. the part i appreciate most is the use cases/real-world scenarios. after this section i have a solid grasp on data structures in python, how they work, why we use them, and when to use them.

module3 section2 had no errors, I particularly liked the section about the context manager built into python using the 'with' keyworkd.
ive already used plenty of times in my code/projects

module3 section3 'Demo - Loading and Displaying Student Profiles from JSON' code snippet is in HTML format instead of Python.
